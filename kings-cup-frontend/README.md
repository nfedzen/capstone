## General info
King's Cup is a drinking game played with a deck of cards and a can of beer! To start the game, the cards are spread around the can. Each player takes turns pulling a card. The value of each card corresponds with a drinking action:
  - Ace: Waterfall
  - 2: You
  - 3: Me
  - 4: Floor
  - 5: Guys
  - 6: Chicks
  - 7: Heaven
  - 8: Date
  - 9: Rhyme
  - 10: Categories
  - Jack: Never Have I Ever
  - Queen: Question Master
  - King: Make a Rule

Once the action is performed, the player puts their card in the tab of the beer can. If the can pops, the person who popped it drinks the beer. To apply that rule, each time you click on a card, there is a chance for the can to pop. The more clicks you take, the higher the chance of the can popping.

## Action Rules
  - Ace: Waterfall: Everyone starts drinking at the same time. When the player who pulled the card stops drinking, the player to his left is then allowed to stop drinking, and so on until everyone has stopped.
  - 2: You: The player who pulled the card picks someone to drink
  - 3: Me: The player who pulled the card drinks
  - 4: Floor: When the card is pulled, everyone points to the floor. The last person to point drinks.
  - 5: Guys: All players who identify as male take a drink.
  - 6: Chicks: All players who identify as female take a drink.
  - 7: Heaven: When the card is pulled, everyone points to the heavens. The last person to point drinks.
  - 8: Date: The player who pulls this card chooses another player to be their date. Whenever either player has to drink, their date also has to drink the same amount.
  - 9: Rhyme: The player who pulls this card chooses a word to rhyme with. Proceeding clockwise, each player says a word that rhymes with the originally chosen word. If someone repeats a word, or can't think of one, they drink.
  - 10: Categories: Same concept as Rhyme, but the player who pulls this card names a category(Animals, colors, movies, etc.) instead of a rhyme.
  - Jack: Never Have I Ever: Self explanatory, start with 3 fingers and move clockwise. The first player or players who pull down all 3 fingers drink.
  - Queen: Question Master: The player who pulls this card becomes the 
  Question Master. Whenever another player answers any question asked by the Question Master, they have to drink. There can only be one Question Master at a time.
  - King: Make a Rule: The player who pulls this card can make any rule that all players much follow for the rest of the game. Breaking the rule results in a drink. Rules stay in effect for the entire game.

## Inspiration
I have always been a fan of drinking games, and with the pandemic, it is difficult to meet in person. I wanted to create a way to play one of my favorite drinking games virtually!
